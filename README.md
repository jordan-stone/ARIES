ARIES echelle-mode software

I made this python package mostly with my own needs in mind and "cut my teeth"
on software organization and the use of git with these codes.

Please feel free to contact me if you need any assistance in implementation.

The dependencies that I know of the top of my head are these:

    - numpy,
    - scipy,
    - matplotlib,
    - poly2d (requires cython, https://github.com/tkanmae/polynomial2d, It seems that
              this project has changed it's name, so that's probably bad...),
    - astropysics (https://github.com/eteq/astropysics),
    - sidereal (http://infohost.nmt.edu/tcc/help/lang/python/examples/sidereal/),
    - pyfits

More words may eventually end up here, maybe even an example or two.
